<h1>About Gabriel(G)</h1>
<p>Hello People, I am Gabriel a web developer(upcoming though lol). I picked interest in web development when i saw my brother doing somecrazy stuffs 
  with the Vs code app and i really wanted to know more about the weird lines and symbols which were colured differently because it seemed a bit
  weird and complex from a far sight or from a lane man's view.
  <p>I started this class some weeks back and i'm really happy i payed for it cause it's another knowledge being learnt from scartch entirely.
i was also procrastinating on getting a new or learning a new skill entirely somewhat some months ago which i didn't do.But due to certain pursuasion from my elder brother and from
the motivation i got from what i saw him doing i had no option than to buy and "make hay while the sun was still shining."</th></p>
<p>I am in my early twenties, currently working and processing my admission to school part time.I am a secondary school graduate and i obtained a certificate in basic graphic designing(2022).
  I am open to new ideas and wish to learn more about anything positive if given the required support and knowledge needed.
</p>
<p>Then to the person who made it possible that i'm writing this little code, Angela Yue.
  She is a really good teach Not gonna lie, she makes every simple code i'm writing seems more easy and less different from what some of my colleagues explained to me.
  Angela makee each class fun in her own way and her teaching style is unique.Thank you Angela if you're seeing this.I really appreciate your efforts.
  And i anticpate a  more great classes ahead with you.
</p>

<p>Then lastly to the one who motivated behind all these little codes, My elder brother, This first little website is dedicated to you.
  Thank you for all you do.
